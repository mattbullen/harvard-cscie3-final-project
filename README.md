# Harvard CSCI E-3 Final Project

This is my final project for Harvard's CSCI E-3 JavaScript programming class, Spring 2015 semester. It's a small Node.js app that demonstrates a cloud-based solution for transferring images from a desktop site to a phone via multimedia text messaging . . . in other words, how to have a website text your phone!

The server-side uses the Twilio.com SMS/MMS cloud API, with Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB + Jade running on a Heroku.com server. The client-side uses jQuery, Bootstrap.js, blueimp.js, and Handlebars.js.
